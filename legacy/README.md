# Legacy

This folder contains legacy files and projects for the Pioneer robot. These are older versions and are kept for historical reference.

## Folders

- [**main_old**](main_old): contains an old PlatformIO project and an Arduino project. These are previous versions of the main code, based on [this project](https://www.hackster.io/amal-shaji/differential-drive-robot-using-ros2-and-esp32-aae289).
- [**pcb_old**](pcb_old): contains version one of the PCB, which included the driver and was less general than the current version.
- [**pioneer_ros1**](pioneer_ros1): contains the old user manual for the Pioneer robot using ROS1 and the code that was used on an Arduino Mega. This represents the state of the robot before the recent updates.
